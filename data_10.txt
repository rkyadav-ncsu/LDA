Kingsley was born Krishna Pandit Bhanji in Snainton, near Scarborough in the North Riding of Yorkshire. He is the son of Anna Lyna Mary (born Goodman; 1914–2010), an actress and model who appeared in films in the 1920s and 1930s, and Rahmitulla Harji Bhanji (1914–1968), a doctor.[8][9]

Kingsley's mother was British; she was born out of wedlock, and "was loath to speak of her background".[10][11] Kingsley's father, born in Kenya, was of Gujarati ancestry.[12] Kingsley's paternal grandfather was an extremely successful spice trader who had moved from India to Zanzibar, where Kingsley's father lived until moving to Britain at the age of 14.[13][14][15] Kingsley's maternal grandfather was believed by the family to have been of Russian- or German-Jewish descent, while Kingsley's maternal grandmother was of English background, and worked in the garment district of East London.[16] Kingsley stated in 1994: "I'm not Jewish … and though there might be some Russian-Jewish heritage way back on my mother's side, the thread is so fine there's no real evidence."[2][17]

Kingsley grew up in Pendlebury, near Manchester. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School, where one of his classmates was the actor Robert Powell.[18]
