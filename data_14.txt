Southern Africa was scrambling on Wednesday to respond to a humanitarian disaster in the wake of Cyclone Idai, as the death toll rose and infrastructure connecting the poor region was destroyed, dealing a heavy economic blow and impeding aid delivery.

The official death toll in Mozambique was 200, with 100 more in neighboring Zimbabwe and dozens more in Malawi. But the governments and aid agencies fear thousands more could be dead and hundreds of thousands displaced across the three countries. Cyclone Idai, a “category 2” storm, gathered to a speed of 109 miles an hour over the Indian Ocean before making landfall in Mozambique late Thursday.

Scientists have graded the cyclone one of the worst weather-related disasters to ever hit the Southern Hemisphere. Aid officials say the cyclone was particularly deadly because it was accompanied by heavy rains that hit densely populated urban areas along the coast with poor drainage infrastructure.
