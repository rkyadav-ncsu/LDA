Scarlett Ingrid Johansson was born in the Manhattan borough of New York City.[1][2] on November 22, 1984.[3] Her father, Karsten Olaf Johansson, is an architect originally from Copenhagen, Denmark, and her paternal grandfather, Ejner Johansson, was an art historian, screenwriter and film director, whose own father was Swedish.[4][5] Scarlett's mother, Melanie Sloan, a producer, comes from an Ashkenazi Jewish family, from Poland and Russia.[6][7] She has an older sister, Vanessa, also an actress; an older brother, Adrian; and a twin brother, Hunter.[8] Johansson also has an older half-brother, Christian, from her father's first marriage. She holds both American and Danish citizenship.[9][10]

Johansson attended PS 41, an elementary school in Greenwich Village, Manhattan.[11] Her parents divorced when she was 13.[12][13] Johansson was particularly close to her maternal grandmother, Dorothy Sloan, a bookkeeper and schoolteacher; they often spent time together and Johansson considered Sloan her best friend.[14] Interested in a career in the spotlight from an early age, she often put on song-and-dance routines for her family. She was particularly fond of musical theater and jazz hands.[15][16] She took lessons in tap dance, and states that her parents were supportive of her career choice. She describes her childhood as very ordinary.[17]
