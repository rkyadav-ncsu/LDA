Natasha Law was born in Lewisham, London, England, on 1 January 1970. Law was the first born child of Margaret Anne (n√©e Heyworth) a comprehensive school teacher, and Peter Robert Law (professionally known as Sir Taggalot) a British actor. Law is also the older sister of Jude Law, an English actor, film producer and director. Due to her mother's encouragement Natasha was introduced to the creative world at a young age. She gained experience acting at the Bob Hope Theatre (then called the Eltham Little Theatre) in Eltham, where she performed in Teenage Follies in 1982. Law's love of art continued on. While she first went to University of Warwick to study history, she soon switched to studying art at Camberwell College of Arts in South London.[1]
