Keith Lionel Urban was born on 26 October 1967, in Whangarei, New Zealand,[4] He is the youngest son of Marienne and Robert "Bob" Urban. He lived with his parents in Caboolture, Queensland, Australia. His father, who owned a convenience store, put an ad for a guitar teacher in his shop window.[5] Urban took lessons from his teacher, Sue McCarthy,[6] and began entering local competitions, in addition to acting in a local theater company.[4] Urban has stated that his guitar playing was influenced by two rock players, Mark Knopfler (Dire Straits) and Lindsey Buckingham (Fleetwood Mac).

In 1983, Urban was a contestant on the Australian TV talent show New Faces.[7] A few years later, he began making the inroads into the Australian country music scene, with regular appearances on the Reg Lindsay Country Homestead TV Program, Mike McClellan's Music Program, and various other TV programs performing duets with local Brisbane girl Jenny Wilson. They won a Golden Guitar award at the Tamworth Country Music Festival. Urban also performed regularly on stage at the Northern Suburbs Country Music Club in Bald Hills, where he was a member. He was in a band called 'Kids Country', that performed during school holidays at various venues and made appearances on the Reg Lindsey show and Conway Country.
